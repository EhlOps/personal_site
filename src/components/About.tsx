          I'm a university student at Northeastern University. My interests
          bounce around, but I always love working with my hands. From cars to
          embedded systems, I strive to find tangible impact with software. In
          the future, I look forward to investigating the cybersecurity of
          critical infrastrucutre. Aside from being a software engineer, I spend
          lots of time playing piano, meeting with friends, and playing
          basketball.
